As my first WCH CH32V project, I decided to read the temperature information of a Dallas DS18B20 sensor through its 1-Wire protocol.

Ported existing **onewire.c** and **ds18b20.c** code from https://github.com/lamik/DS18B20_STM32_HAL to CH32V003 using [Embeetle IDE](https://www.embeetle.com/).

Enjoy!
